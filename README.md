# dotfiles
A collection of dotfiles that I need to store somewhere... 

This is currently just a collection of Lua files for my nvim.

Please note that I use the following:
* goneovim (todo: add link!) as a GUI, but this is subject to change at any moment.
* Windows 10 as an environment
* Powershell as a shell (currently not working)

I primary use Vim to program Web2Py/Py4Web apps (todo: add links), and I am migrating everything to Py4Web.
I am also learning Lua and intend to be making a plugin for NVim-Telescope (todo: add link) that will allow easy lookup of Bible references out of a SQLite DB.

## This whole thing is a WIP
Beware that it could change radically at any moment, it not for others to use at the moment :)
